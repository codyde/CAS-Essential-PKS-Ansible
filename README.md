# Overview

This set of blueprints will successfully leverage Wardroom (created by the Heptio team) to deploy Essential PKS (highly available, conformant to standards, Kubernetes distribution).

This package consists of a set of Ansible content including...

* Playbooks
* Vars file
* Template files

As well as a Cloud Automation Services (CAS) blueprint and Pipeline.

From a CAS perspective, this package requires that the Ansible integration be configured. More details are in the README.md file within the CAS Blueprint directory.
